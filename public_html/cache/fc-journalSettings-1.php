    'en_US' => 'The copyediting stage is intended to improve the flow, clarity, grammar, wording, and formatting of the article. It represents the last chance for the author to make any substantial changes to the text because the next stage is restricted to typos and formatting corrections. The file to be copyedited is in Word or .rtf format and therefore can easily be edited as a word processing document. The set of instructions displayed here proposes two approaches to copyediting. One is based on Microsoft Word\'s Track Changes feature and requires that the copy editor, editor, and author have access to this program. A second system, which is software independent, has been borrowed, with permission, from the Harvard Educational Review. The journal editor is in a position to modify these instructions, so suggestions can be made to improve the process for this journal.<h4>Copyediting Systems</h4><strong>1. Microsoft Word\'s Track Changes</strong> Under Tools in the menu bar, the feature Track Changes enables the copy editor to make insertions (text appears in color) and deletions (text appears crossed out in color or in the margins as deleted). The copy editor can posit queries to both the author (Author Queries) and to the editor (Editor Queries) by inserting these queries in square brackets. The copyedited version is then uploaded, and the editor is notified. The editor then reviews the text and notifies the author. The editor and author should leave those changes with which they are satisfied. If further changes are necessary, the editor and author can make changes to the initial insertions or deletions, as well as make new insertions or deletions elsewhere in the text. Authors and editors should respond to each of the queries addressed to them, with responses placed inside the square brackets. After the text has been reviewed by editor and author, the copy editor will make a final pass over the text accepting the changes in preparation for the layout and galley stage. <strong>2. Harvard Educational Review </strong> <strong>Instructions for Making Electronic Revisions to the Manuscript</strong> Please follow the following protocol for making electronic revisions to your manuscript: <strong>Responding to suggested changes.</strong>   For each of the suggested changes that you accept, unbold the text.   For each of the suggested changes that you do not accept, re-enter the original text and <strong>bold</strong> it. <strong>Making additions and deletions.</strong>   Indicate additions by <strong>bolding</strong> the new text.   Replace deleted sections with: <strong>[deleted text]</strong>.   If you delete one or more sentence, please indicate with a note, e.g., <strong>[deleted 2 sentences]</strong>. <strong>Responding to Queries to the Author (QAs).</strong>   Keep all QAs intact and bolded within the text. Do not delete them.   To reply to a QA, add a comment after it. Comments should be delimited using: <strong>[Comment:]</strong>   e.g., <strong>[Comment: Expanded discussion of methodology as you suggested]</strong>. <strong>Making comments.</strong>   Use comments to explain organizational changes or major revisions   e.g., <strong>[Comment: Moved the above paragraph from p. 5 to p. 7].</strong>  Note: When referring to page numbers, please use the page numbers from the printed copy of the manuscript that was sent to you. This is important since page numbers may change as a document is revised electronically.<h4>An Illustration of an Electronic Revision</h4><ol><li><strong>Initial copyedit.</strong> The journal copy editor will edit the text to improve flow, clarity, grammar, wording, and formatting, as well as including author queries as necessary. Once the initial edit is complete, the copy editor will upload the revised document through the journal Web site and notify the author that the edited manuscript is available for review.</li><li><strong>Author copyedit.</strong> Before making dramatic departures from the structure and organization of the edited manuscript, authors must check in with the editors who are co-chairing the piece. Authors should accept/reject any changes made during the initial copyediting, as appropriate, and respond to all author queries. When finished with the revisions, authors should rename the file from AuthorNameQA.doc to AuthorNameQAR.doc (e.g., from LeeQA.doc to LeeQAR.doc) and upload the revised document through the journal Web site as directed.</li><li><strong>Final copyedit.</strong> The journal copy editor will verify changes made by the author and incorporate the responses to the author queries to create a final manuscript. When finished, the copy editor will upload the final document through the journal Web site and alert the layout editor to complete formatting.</li></ol>',

    'en_US' => '<p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Types of articles</strong></span></p><p>There are four categories of submission:</p><p><strong>Original Research Papers</strong></p><p>present new empirical results contributing to theoretical, methodological, and/or applied advances (with a maximum length of 8,000 words, including references but excluding tables and figures). Articles longer than 8,000 words will be accepted on an occasional basis.</p><p><strong>Research Notes </strong></p><p>similar to original articles but shorter in nature (with a maximum length of 3,000 words, including references but excluding tables and figures).</p><p><strong>Review Articles </strong></p><p>summarize and integrate a clearly defined literature and make theoretical advances in this area (with a maximum length of 10,000 words, including references but excluding tables and figures). Articles longer than 10,000 words will be accepted on an occasional basis. Policy reviews fall in this category.</p><p><strong>Case Studies</strong></p><p>present good descriptions of experiences from particular contexts that allow lessons to be learned. It need not be a successful case, lessons can be learnt from failure. An article containing a case study should address the following questions: what are the context variables that made it a success or a failure; how can we transfer lessons from this case elsewhere. Case studies should be under 6,000 words, including references but excluding tables and figures.</p><p><strong>Peer review</strong> <br /> <br /> This journal operates a double blind review process. All contributions will be initially assessed by the editor for suitability for the journal. Papers deemed suitable are then typically sent to a minimum of two independent expert reviewers to assess the scientific quality of the paper. The Editor is responsible for the final decision regarding acceptance or rejection of articles. The Editor\'s decision is final. <strong></strong></p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Article structure</strong></span></p><p><em><strong>Introduction</strong></em> <br /> State the objectives of the work and provide an adequate background, with extended theories that lay the foundation for further work.</p><p><em><strong>Methods</strong></em> <br /> Provide sufficient detail to allow the work to be reproduced. Methods already published should be indicated by a reference: only relevant modifications should be described.</p><p><em><strong>Results</strong></em> <br /> Results should be clear and concise.</p><p><em><strong>Discussion</strong></em> <br /> This should explore the significance of the results of the work, not repeat them. A combined Results and Discussion section is often appropriate. Avoid extensive citations and discussion of published literature.</p><p><em><strong>Conclusions</strong></em> <br /> The main conclusions of the study may be presented in a short Conclusions section, which may stand alone or form a subsection of a Discussion or Results and Discussion section.<strong></strong></p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p><strong>Title page information</strong></p><ul><li><strong><em>Title.</em></strong> Concise and informative. Titles are often used in information-retrieval systems. Avoid abbreviations and formulae where possible.</li><li><strong><em>Author names and affiliations.</em></strong> Please clearly indicate the given name(s) and family name(s) of each author and check that all names are accurately spelled. Present the authors\' affiliation addresses (where the actual work was done) below the names. Indicate all affiliations with a lower-case superscript letter immediately after the author\'s name and in front of the appropriate address. Provide the full postal address of each affiliation, including the country name and, if available, the e-mail address of each author.</li><li><strong><em>Corresponding author.</em></strong> Clearly indicate who will handle correspondence at all stages of refereeing and publication, also post-publication. <strong>Ensure that the e-mail address is given and that contact details are kept up to date by the corresponding author.</strong></li><li><strong><em>Present/permanent address.</em></strong> If an author has moved since the work described in the article was done, or was visiting at the time, a \'Present address\' (or \'Permanent address\') may be indicated as a footnote to that author\'s name. The address at which the author actually did the work must be retained as the main, affiliation address. Superscript Arabic numerals are used for such footnotes.</li></ul><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p><strong>Abstract</strong> <br /> <br /> A concise and factual abstract is required. The abstract should state briefly the purpose of the research, the principal results and major conclusions. An abstract is often presented separately from the article, so it must be able to stand alone. For this reason, References should be avoided, but if essential, then cite the author(s) and year(s). Also, non-standard or uncommon abbreviations should be avoided, but if essential they must be defined at their first mention in the abstract itself. Abstracts must be 200 words or fewer. </p><p><strong>Keywords</strong> <br /> <br /> Immediately after the abstract, provide a maximum of 6 keywords, using American spelling and avoiding general and plural terms and multiple concepts (avoid, for example, \'and\', \'of\'). Be sparing with abbreviations: only abbreviations firmly established in the field may be eligible. These keywords will be used for indexing purposes.</p><p><em><strong>Acknowledgements</strong></em><em> </em><em></em></p><p>Collate acknowledgements in a separate section at the end of the article before the references and do not, therefore, include them on the title page, as a footnote to the title or otherwise. List here those individuals who provided help during the research (e.g., providing language help, writing assistance or proof reading the article, etc.).</p><p><strong>Headings </strong></p><p>Appropriate headings should be used to help organize the manuscript and should follow <em>APA Style Manual</em> guidelines. Typical headings for quantitative and qualitative research articles include review of literature, method, results, discussion, and references. For theoretical manuscripts, authors are encouraged to use headings that clarify the flow of the manuscript as well as assist the reader in understanding the content of the paper. Authors are encouraged to use up to two (2) additional levels of headings in accordance with <em>APA Style Manual </em>guidelines.</p><p><strong>Tables and figures </strong></p><p>Tables should be titled and numbered at the top of the table. They should be numbered consecutively as they appear in the text. Tables should be clear, concise, and able to stand alone. Complete headings and footnotes should be included to clarify entries. Figures should be numbered consecutively, at the bottom of the figure, with a short and concise description. Fonts used in any table or figure should be compatible with that used in the text. All tables and figures should be referred to in the text with a notation made in the manuscript indicating approximately where each should be located. Illustrations should be of professional quality and supplied in EPS, tiff, or PDF formats.</p><p><strong>Permissions </strong></p><p>The author(s) is responsible for providing copies of written permission for lengthy quotations or reprinted or adapted tables or figures. It is the responsibility of the author(s) to check with the publisher or copyright owner regarding specific requirements for permission to adapt or quote from copyrighted material. See the <em>APA Style Manual</em> for guidelines.</p><p><strong>Literature cited </strong></p><p>All citations and references must be complete and accurate on submission and should follow the <em>APA Style Manual</em>. Papers cannot be reviewed if they have references that are found to be incomplete or inaccurate.</p><p><strong>For Authors</strong></p><ol><li>Author(s) affirm that the material has not been previously published and that they have not trans­ferred elsewhere any rights to the article.</li><li>Author(s) should ensure the originality of the work and they have properly cited others’ work in accordance of the references format.</li><li>Author(s) should not engage in plagiarism nor self-plagiarism.</li><li>Author(s) should ensure that they follow the authorship criteria that are taken from APA that is explained in instruction for author of PRoUSt.</li><li>The author(s) haven’t suggested any personal information that may make the identity of the patient recognizable in any forms of description part, photograph or pedigree. When the photographs of the patient were essential and indispensable as scientific information, the author(s) have received the consent in written form and have clearly stated it.</li><li>In case of experimenting on human, the authors have certified that the process of the research is in accordance with ethical standards of Helsinki declaration, domestic and foreign committees that preside over human experi­ment. If any doubts are raised whether the research was proceeded in accordance with the declaration, the authors should explain it. In case of experimenting on animals, the authors have certified that the authors had followed the domestic and foreign guideline related to experiment of animals in a laboratory.</li><li>Author(s) should give the editor the data and details of the work, if there are suspicions of data falsification or fabrication.</li><li>Authors of the journal should clarify everything that may cause conflict of interests such as work, research expenses, consul­tant expenses, and intellectual property.</li></ol>',
